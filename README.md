# FASKY
fasky is an application with functions that improve the experience in windows, the functions are:
- QuickShift, the main function, uses the prolonged pressure of a key to exploit it as a shortcut, by default when you hold down a character for more than 0.3s it is rewritten in uppercase, if a numeric character is held down for more than 0.3s a symbol such as an arrow or other will be written, all alphanumeric keys are customizable with both characters and entire sentences.
- text concatenator, to avoid consecutive copy and paste as soon as you click ctrl+shift+c all the text that is copied is concatenated and can be released with a simple ctrl+v
- case converter, it is a very useful function, when you make a mistake in writing a text all in uppercase instead of all in lowercase or vice versa just select it and pressing shift + CAPS LOCK it will be converted (abcd → ABCD)
- translator, a function that by selecting some text and pressing ctrl + f8 allows you to translate English text into Italian and vice versa, the text is automatically detected
- clipboard manager allows you to have various slots in which to put your notes, a function still with some bugs
